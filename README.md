It's a simple app with two branches one of theme is implemented by react and redux. and another branch has built by react and reduxToolkit.this app has two products that can purchased in any quantity.I also built an async action userReducer with the help of redux-thunk in the first-branch; so that i can manage the data that is sent with a delayed response.
